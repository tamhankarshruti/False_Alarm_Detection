# False_Alarm_Detection

This project aimed to reduce false alarms in a chemical industry detecting H2S gas leaks. Using sensor data (temperature, calibration, humidity, H2S content), a Logistic Regression model was trained to classify whether an alarm is dangerous or not. The system saves costs by only dispatching teams for real hazards.
